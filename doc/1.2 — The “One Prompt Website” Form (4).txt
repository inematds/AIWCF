2. Branding Guidelines:
-----

1. Visual Identity ("Titanium & Glass")
- Typography: Use Inter or SF Pro Display. Headlines should be massive (60px+) and tight. Body text should be small but high-contrast.
- Color Palette: Deep "Space Gray" background (#0d0d0d), Text is "Off-White" (#f5f5f7). Accents are subtle "Titanium Blue" gradients, not bright neon.
- Shapes: Everything uses "Squircle" (super-ellipse) corners (30px radius).
- Materials: Extensive use of backdrop-filter: blur(20px) (frosted glass) with very thin, subtle white borders (1px, 10% opacity).

2. Motion ("Fluid Physics")
- No jerky movements. Use distinct ease-out curves (cubic-bezier).
- Parallax: As I scroll, the text should slide over the images.
- Scrollytelling: Elements shouldn't just appear; they should bloom or fade in upwards as if they are heavy.

3. Mobile & Quality
- Responsiveness: On mobile, the experience must feel like a native app. Full-width images, large touch areas.
- Imagery: Images should be the "Hero." Give them massive scale, often edge-to-edge.
