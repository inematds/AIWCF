## Transcrição 1 — Introdução ao Vibe Coding

[0:00] Welcome to week one of the course, and welcome to the future of web creation.
[0:04] Today, you're going to learn a completely new way of building websites, a
[0:08] method called
[0:08] vibe coding, where instead of writing code, you describe the vibes of your site
[0:13] and AI does the
[0:14] heavy lifting. This week's goal is simple. By the end of today, you'll have
[0:18] built a professional
[0:19] one page website generated from one single prompt. You'll learn the
[0:23] fundamentals of vibe
[0:24] coding, and how to use tools like Firebase Studio to turn natural language into
[0:29] HTML and CSS.
[0:30] Vibe coding is all about describing design intention, the mood, structure,
[0:35] spacing,
[0:35] hierarchy, in plain language. Think of it as directing the AI rather than
[0:39] coding. No technical
[0:40] experience needed. You focus on creativity, the AI handles the structure.
[0:45] Instead of writing code
[0:47] line by line, you communicate the website's layout, style, mood, and energy. It
[0:52] 's a shift from manual
[0:53] construction to AI powered direction. This is the core mindset that unlocks
[0:57] everything else we do
[0:58] today. By the end of this module, you'll be able to produce something like this
[1:02] , a fully branded
[1:03] clean modern one page website built in under an hour from one prompt. The key
[1:08] is the one prompt
[1:09] website formula. This is how you write a single structured prompt that becomes
[1:13] the blueprint for
[1:14] your entire site. The better your prompt, the better your AI generated layout.
[1:19] You'll learn
[1:19] how to describe spacing, typography, mood, and visuals in a way AI understands.
[1:25] So you get clean,
[1:26] modern, premium layouts instead of cluttered results. Once your prompt is ready
[1:30] , you'll drop
[1:31] it into Firebase Studio. The AI instantly generates your HTML, CSS structure,
[1:37] your website's skeleton
[1:38] in seconds. The first output will already be a complete responsive layout. Then
[1:43] you'll refine
[1:44] spacing, hierarchy, and make the UX feel intentional and polished. After the
[1:48] structure is solid, we
[1:50] bring in your brand, colors, typography, logo, hero section, and your core
[1:54] messaging. We'll also
[1:55] use AI to generate text and images. So your site feels complete without you
[1:59] writing everything
[2:00] manually. This will be a neon glass morphism style. This is the exact look and
[2:05] atmosphere I want the
[2:06] AI to create for me. So the page feels modern and polished. And then I need the
[2:10] position details
[2:11] listed clearly. If you provide more specific information, it will become a much
[2:15] better
[2:16] instruction for the AI, helping it avoid inconsistencies. So that's our plan
[2:20] for week one. We start with
[2:21] the vibes, write one clean prompt, then let AI build, finally refine and brand
[2:26] it. This is the
[2:27] new generation of web creation. And today you'll learn how to do it yourself.

## Transcrição 2 — One Prompt Website Formula

[0:00] First of all, we're going to go through the one prompt website formula, which
[0:03] is a simple framework that allows you to generate a complete premium looking
[0:07] website using just one well-structured prompt.
[0:10] Instead of writing code instead of building a design system manually, you're
[0:15] going to learn how to describe the structure, the branding, and the content in
[0:19] a way that the AI can understand clearly.
[0:21] Once you master this approach, you'll be able to create websites that look
[0:25] intentional, cohesive, and extremely high quality.
[0:29] All from a single prompt, the entire system is built around clarity, structure,
[0:34] and visual language, and by the end of this session, you'll understand exactly
[0:39] how to write a prompt that produces a polished professional website.
[0:42] The prompt includes three key parts, page structure, branding guidelines, and
[0:47] content details.
[0:48] When you combine them into a single prompt, you can send it to Firebase Studio
[0:52] and generate the entire website outline in one shot.
[0:55] Step one, structure of a successful one prompt website. The first step is
[0:58] understanding the structure. Before the AI can generate anything meaningful, it
[1:02] needs a clear outline of the sections that will appear on the page.
[1:05] Think of this like giving the AI a map. When you define the structure up front,
[1:10] the AI knows what to generate, in what order, and how the content should flow.
[1:14] A simple universal structure that works for almost any marketing or portfolio
[1:19] site includes six core sections, the header, the hero, the about section, the
[1:23] services section, the call to action, and the footer.
[1:26] This is the foundation of your website. It's clean, it's simple, and it creates
[1:31] a natural flow from introduction to credibility, to offering, to conversion.
[1:35] When you present this structure inside your prompt, the AI knows exactly how
[1:39] many sections to build, what each section's purpose is, and where the user's
[1:43] attention should go as they scroll.
[1:45] This structure becomes the skeleton that the rest of your design will attach to
[1:49] .
[1:49] Step two, how to describe branding details, typography, and visuals. Once the
[1:54] structure is clear, the next step is giving the AI the visual identity of your
[1:59] brand.
[1:59] Most people skip this part, and that's why their AI-generated websites look
[2:04] generic. When you want a premium, consistent outcome, you must describe the
[2:07] branding with clear, intentional visual language.
[2:09] Start with the visual identity. Describe your typography choices, such as using
[2:14] SF Pro Display with massive tight headlines and small, high-contrast body text.
[2:19] Describe your color palette. For example, a deep space gray background. Off
[2:25] white text. And subtle, titanium blue gradients.
[2:28] Instead of neon colors. Describe the shapes you want, such as squirkel corners.
[2:33] And describe the materials you want, such as frosted glass surfaces with
[2:38] backdrop filter blur and thin transparent borders.
[2:40] These details guide the AI toward a coherent design style, instead of random
[2:45] results. Next, describe the motion.
[2:46] If you want smooth, elegant animations, explain that the movement should follow
[2:51] fluid physics, with ease-out curves, soft parallax effects, and scrolly telling
[2:56] where elements gently bloom into view instead of popping in.
[2:58] This is how you communicate your motion personality. Finally, describe mobile
[3:02] and quality expectations. Tell the AI that the site should feel like a native
[3:06] mobile app, with full width images, large touch targets, and high impact
[3:10] imagery.
[3:10] By describing these details upfront, you're giving the AI a strong visual
[3:16] foundation. Every section it generates will automatically follow your typ
[3:21] ography rules, color rules, shape rules, motion rules, and mobile rules.
[3:25] This combination of structure and visual identity is what prepares the AI to
[3:30] create a website that is consistent, aesthetic, and aligned with your brand.
[3:34] Now we're moving into step three, which is all about making the AI produce
[3:38] detailed, premium content exactly the way you want.
[3:41] At this stage, you already understand the structure of a one-prompt website,
[3:45] and you understand how to tent inside each section.
[3:47] The first thing you must do is separate each section clearly. When you label
[3:51] your prompt with header, hero, about, services, CTA, and footer, the AI
[3:55] immediately understands the layout of your website.
[3:57] Without this, structure tends to merge sections together or forget parts
[4:03] entirely. A clear outline gives the model a blueprint to follow.
[4:07] Next, for every section, you always need to provide three types of instructions
[4:11] . The first is the content inputs.
[4:13] These are the exact words you want the AI to use. Headlines, subtitles, CTA
[4:18] labels, BIOS, stats, navigation links, and so on.
[4:21] Giving these inputs ensures the text is accurate, consistent, and never made up
[4:26] . The second type is the content elements.
[4:28] This is where you describe how the interface should be arranged. You explain
[4:32] things like a glass button, a bento grid layout, three equal height service
[4:36] cards, or a pill-shaped navigation bar.
[4:40] These instructions determine the structure of the UI, the hierarchy, and how
[4:46] the content is visually organized.
[4:48] The third type is styling and visual instructions. This is where you define the
[4:52] look and feel. You describe elements like frosted glass with blur, a dark void
[4:56] background, massive typography, subtle motion, and thin line icons.
[5:00] These details create consistency and a premium aesthetic across the entire
[5:04] website. After that, it's extremely helpful to use style references.
[5:08] When you mention real visual cues, like Apple TVs, Light Ribbons, macOS Sonoma
[5:13] dynamic wallpapers, or iOS control center's glass effects, the AI instantly
[5:19] anchors onto a clear design style.
[5:22] This improves accuracy and reduces randomness dramatically. To help you
[5:27] understand how this works, let's walk through one example together using the
[5:31] hero section.
[5:32] For the hero section, we start with the content inputs. The headline is your
[5:37] SEO growth engine. The subtitle is a single sentence explaining how it helps
[5:41] clients grow.
[5:42] The primary call to action is get free audit. And we specify that no image is
[5:48] needed because the background will handle the visual impact.
[5:52] These inputs prevent the AI from inventing text and keep the messaging
[5:57] consistent.
[5:58] Next are the content elements. We tell the AI that the CTA should be a glass
[6:02] button with no pulsing animation and that the subtitle should fade in half a
[6:07] second after the headline.
[6:08] These instructions control the interface and the micro interaction behavior.
[6:12] Then we define the background. We describe a slow moving abstract 3D mesh or
[6:17] fluid light ribbons on a dark void based color with very subtle motion.
[6:21] This creates a cinematic Apple style atmosphere. We also include extra elements
[6:31] . The hero gets a soft vignette around the edges and a very large headline,
[6:31] These small details elevate the overall design. Finally, we add style
[6:31] somewhere between 60 and 80 pixels.
[6:35] references. We mention Apple TV's screensaver ribbons, Mac OS Sonoma's dynamic
[6:40] wallpapers, and fluid physics ease out motion.
[6:43] By referencing real visuals, the AI knows the exact feeling we're aiming for.
[6:53] So when you combine all of this together, the content, the layout, the visuals,
[6:54] the motion, and the references, the AI is able to generate a hero section that
[6:57] looks professional, cinematic, and consistent with the brand.
[7:00] And the big idea is this. When you describe every section using the same method
[7:05] , you get pixel perfect layouts, a consistent visual language, accurate content,
[7:11] and a unified brand identity from top to bottom.
[7:14] This is the foundation of vibe coding. All right. Okay, we already have the
[7:19] prompt fully prepared. So the next step is to properly implement this or
[7:23] execute it inside Firebase.

## Transcrição 3 — Execução no Firebase Studio

[0:00] Now we've arrived at the section where we will actually run the prompt we built
[0:04] earlier, directly inside Firebase Studio.
[0:08] And this is where everything begins to come together.
[0:11] You can access Firebase Studio from, well, this is still temporary, but
[0:16] currently you can go to studio.firebase.google.com.
[0:20] I highly recommend logging in first, so all of your AI-generated prompts and
[0:28] prototypes.
[0:29] Are stored under your own Google account, making everything traceable and
[0:32] organized.
[0:33] Once you're inside, all right, I will copy my entire prompt into Firebase.
[0:37] Everything is placed inside the main text box.
[0:40] And the question now is, how do we run this so the AI actually executes our
[0:46] entire prompt?
[0:47] It's very straightforward. You just need to click the prototype with AI button.
[0:52] When you click that, Firebase Studio will begin processing your prompt and
[0:56] converting it into actual code.
[0:58] After that, Firebase will automatically generate an app blueprint for you.
[1:02] From there, you can tweak the blueprint however you want, color, layout, typ
[1:07] ography, icons, animations, basically everything.
[1:10] You can customize all of this using prompts, or if everything looks acceptable
[1:15] already, you can simply click prototype this app.
[1:19] So you can still edit or adjust things later after the website is generated.
[1:23] Right now we're just waiting for the prompt to be executed. It looks like the
[1:27] code has already been generated here, as you can see inside the preview.
[1:30] And now we're just waiting for this part to finish compiling, all right?
[1:34] So now our website is generated, but I need to re-enter my Gemini API key for
[1:39] the next step.
[1:40] Click on generate again to continue. All good.
[1:43] And now this is our website, already created with just a single, very detailed
[1:47] AI prompt that we built earlier.
[1:49] If you want to modify or change anything like fonts, styling, or colors, then
[1:53] yeah, it's very easy.
[1:55] You can simply click select and then you can add descriptions or instructions
[1:59] right there.
[2:00] For example, you can change the wording your SEO growth engine into something
[2:04] more AI catchy.
[2:05] So it becomes extremely easy to let the AI generate the updated version.
[2:12] Yeah, all right. So as you can see, the wording has already been changed and
[2:16] the updated style looks much more bold.
[2:19] You can continue adjusting all the styles, templates, icons, images, or
[2:23] anything you want using this Select-O-Base workflow.
[2:26] Or if you prefer, you can use the annotation tool directly on the webpage.
[2:32] The AI will automatically recognize your notes and apply changes such as
[2:37] updating the style, changing the font type, modifying colors,
[2:41] or anything else you comment on.
[2:43] So after everything looks good here, you can publish it.
[2:46] Or if you want to inspect the underlying code, you can simply switch to the
[2:50] code view.
[2:51] You'll be able to see all the generated code clearly.
[2:54] If you have some coding skills and want to refine or adjust certain things on
[2:58] the front end, you can modify the code directly from this view.
[3:02] And if you want to connect this to GitHub or any other repository, you can do
[3:06] that as well.
[3:12] Simply publish a branch.
[3:15] For example, let's say I want to connect this project with my GitHub repository
[3:20] .
[3:20] I can authorize the connection and then push all the generated code there, so
[3:28] everything stays properly version controlled.
[3:38] So in this example, the Firebase tutorial code, or whatever project you create,
[3:43] will be automatically recorded in our GitHub repository like this.
[3:47] This gives you a full workflow from prompt to code to version storage.
[3:51] So either you publish the website directly from Firebase, you can host all the
[3:56] generated code on another platform that supports front end hosting.
[3:59] Any of these options will work for deploying everything generated inside Fire
[4:02] base.
[4:03] And that's the full journey from defining a clear page structure to crafting an
[4:08] extremely detailed single prompt,
[4:10] all the way to generating and refining a complete website inside Firebase
[4:14] Studio.
[4:15] What I want you to take away is this.
[4:17] When you combine structured thinking with highly specific instructions, AI can
[4:20] produce production ready interfaces with just one prompt.
[4:24] Every section we built, header, hero, about services, CTA and footer, was
[4:28] transformed into real code instantly.
[4:30] And even after generation, you still have full control to tweak, copy, styling,
[4:34] colors, animations, layout,
[4:36] or even jump into the code editor or connect everything to GitHub.
[4:39] So that's the power of vibe coded web development.
[4:42] You design with intention, describe exactly what you want and let AI handle the
[4:46] heavy lifting.
[4:47] Thanks for watching and I hope this helps you build your own AI generated
[4:51] website, faster, cleaner and way more creatively.
